When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to share my work with others, I would need a remote. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There might be changes on the remote that I do not need, those created by others. It could overwrite my work. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is cloning on Github. Cloning is the process of creating a copy of a repository. Branching creates a new path in a repository. It creates a new line of commit-history.
