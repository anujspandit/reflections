When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to share my work with others, I would need a remote. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There might be changes on the remote that I do not need, those created by others. It could overwrite my work. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is cloning on Github. Cloning is the process of creating a copy of a repository. Branching creates a new path in a repository. It creates a new line of commit-history. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Good to know what is out-of-sync. You can then resolve conflicts locally and push changes to the remote. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I would use clone / push / pull. But communicating with collaborators would be difficult.
